    <h2>The bes sandwich</h2>
    <p>When I was a kid, we often spent all day at the community pool. Wed leisurely snack on popsicles and chips, until it was time for lunch.</p>
    <p>No one wanted to dry off, get dressed, and go home for lunch. </p>
    <p>Mayonnaise didnt travel well and wasnt safe under the summer sun. </p>
    <p> Peanut butter sandwiches were a solution, but also suffered under the heat. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 round bread loaf</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        
        <li> 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        
        <li> 1/2 pound sliced deli ham</li>
        
        <li> 1/2 pound sliced deli turkey</li>
        
        <li> 6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        
        <li> 6 slices Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you’re making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top.</li>
        <li>
            Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break through the sides. The loaf interior can be used to make croutons, so there’s no waste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in a small bowl. Mix well. 
        </li>
        <li>Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf and top; place loaf and top on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the hollowed-out loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of ham and turkey. Repeat until the loaf is full. Top with reserved bread top.</li>
        <li>Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top with something to weigh it down.</li>
        <li>Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular sections.</li>
    </ol>
